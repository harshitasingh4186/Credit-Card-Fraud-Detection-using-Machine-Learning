# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-Machine-Learning
This project implements Credit Card Fraud Detection using machine learning techniques. It processes transaction data, applies feature engineering, and trains models to classify fraudulent vs. legitimate transactions. Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook) using a CSV dataset, with models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest.

🔍 Overview:
This project focuses on detecting credit card fraud using machine learning algorithms. Given a dataset of transactions, the model identifies patterns to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate. Fraud detection is critical in financial security, preventing unauthorized transactions and reducing losses for businesses and consumers.

📂 Files Included:
📄 creditcard.csv – A dataset containing credit card transactions with labels indicating fraud or non-fraud.
📜 ML_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb – A Jupyter Notebook implementing data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and fraud classification models.

🛠 Project Workflow:

1️⃣ Data Preprocessing & Cleaning 🧹
Load and inspect the dataset for missing values and outliers.
Normalize features for better model performance.
Address class imbalance using Oversampling (SMOTE) or Undersampling.

2️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊
Visualizing transaction distributions and identifying anomalies.
Checking correlations between variables and fraud cases.

3️⃣ Feature Engineering & Selection ⚙️
Extracting meaningful patterns from transaction data.
Applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

4️⃣ Model Selection & Training 🤖
Implementing multiple classifiers:
✅ Logistic Regression
